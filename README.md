# ~= Doof sphere lights =~

Arduino code for the SH-055 board from Scott LED: https://scottled.en.alibaba.com/

Requires the following libraries:
 * FastLed: http://fastled.io/
 * Pushbutton
 * EnableInterrupt 

The great thing about this board is that it has a WS2811 chip on both sides of the board. This means that each sphere is
actually 2 pixels! Having 2 pixels per sphere allows for some great effects...Unfortunately they seemed to have stopped
manufacturing it so you will need to contact them to see if it can be ordered.
